# Drunk-cockroach
I'm in the College of Computer Science, in the Data Structures course, Professor  gave us Tusk the  game
Drunk Cockroach Project:
There was a  cockroach that accidentally fell into a cup of wine and then fell into a random maze. Whenever it stands on a square randomly, the color of the square changes and continues to jump until it jumps on all the squares

  He wants us to draw a cockroach with curves and lines and then draw a grid with lines. He wants the cockroach to continue jumping until it jumps over all the squares and then stands on the condition that whenever it jumps, it takes a random color.
